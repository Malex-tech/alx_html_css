Don’t worry about float values – round up or down for cleaner CSS

Refer to the design spacing and font sizes – precision is key

If using Figma: "Duplicate to Drafts" for full control of the design file

💡 Pro Tips

Keep your selectors simple and reusable

Organize styles top-down (layout, components, utilities)

Test on various screen sizes (mobile-first is smart)

Comment your CSS for clarity if working in teams
