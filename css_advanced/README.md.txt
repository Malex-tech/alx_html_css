# Advanced HTML Structure Project

## 📄 Description

This project is part of an HTML and CSS series focused on recreating a webpage layout from a Figma design. The current version includes only the semantic HTML structure — no styling or CSS has been applied yet.

The goal is to build the entire page structure using clean, semantic HTML tags that reflect the design layout.

## 📐 Layout Sections Implemented

The HTML structure currently includes the following sections:

- **Header** — Contains site logo and navigation links
- **Banner** — Hero section with a call-to-action and intro content
- **Quote** — Testimonial block with image, quote, and author details
- **Videos** — List of video tutorials with ratings and author info
- **Membership** — Section showcasing different membership tiers
- **FAQ** — Frequently Asked Questions grouped in blocks
- **Footer** — Contains logo, social links, and legal info
